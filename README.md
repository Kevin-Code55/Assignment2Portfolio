Citations 
A significant portion of the server setup and routing structure is based off of examples of code that were provided in INFR3120 lectures as well as the webzip file
The project uses Bootstrap framework and Font Awesome icon library 
The webzip file kept corrupting from Canvas so got the file from classmate Haider Raza 
Got help from another classmate Tabitha Hannas for trouble shooting the ejs files not all routing properly 
Used parts from Assignment 1 to complete Assignment 2
Used Lecture Videos and Tutorials from INFR 3120 to complete/help with assignment 2
